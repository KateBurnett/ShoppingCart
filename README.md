# Shopping Cart
## MIT API and DB Exercise
<br>
<b>Description:</b> Our task in this activity was to create shopping cart that can add products from the available stock, return products from the cart to the product list, and restock products from a Strapi database.<br>
<br>
<b>How to Run:</b> Fork project onto local machine and run on local server.<br>
<br>
<b>Future improvements:</b> Future iterations will change the deleteFromCart and addToCart function so product stock is changed based on the index of the product, not the name. This should fix the problem of multile products of the same name adding to the cart or increasing stock when a product of the same name is added or deleted to the cart respectively.<br>
